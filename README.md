### Hi 👋 I'm [Sascha](https://sascha.is), a [Drupal contributor & Drupal Core Claro Maintainer](https://www.drupal.org/u/saschaeggi), [Designer](https://dribbble.com/saschaeggi) & [Speaker](https://noti.st/saschaeggi) from Zurich, Switzerland.

I contribute a lot of my leisure time to Open Source, especially Drupal 💧. If you love what I do and would like to support it – by sponsoring a cookie 🍪, a beer 🍺 (or two 🍻) or help me out with even bigger funding – this would help me to even work more focused (and faster) on my Open Source projects 👏. Thanks a lot – you're awesome 💙. [Learn more](https://github.com/sponsors/saschaeggi)
